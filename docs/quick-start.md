# Quick start

You can use the standalone version of downforce if you want to get started right
away. This version is built with the default settings and can be linked directly
from unpkg.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://foo-bar/downforce.min.css">
```

Once downforce is included in your HTML file, you can start using the utilities.

```html
<article class="p-4 flex flex-column">
</article>
```



Head over to the [cheatsheet](/docs/utilities/cheatsheet) to see the complete
list of available utilities.
